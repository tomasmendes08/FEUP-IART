# IART

## Compile and Run

The project was built in the jupyter-notebook.

Open the file with the extension .ipynb in the browser and run the program. The notebook will already present the expected outputs of the input for each block of code, and will accompanied by a description of what is done.


Note:

- The block of code for the Artificial Neural Network algorithm takes some time to process.
- The root folder must contain a 'data' folder with the .csv data
